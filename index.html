        <h3>Humble Beginning</h3>
        <p class="interesting">Fimmel's modelling career first began when he was spotted working out at a gym in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn by the flatmate of Matthew Anderson, a talent scout for the Chadwick Models agency.He was named one of
          the world's sexiest bachelors by America's People magazine in 2002 and at the time was regarded as "the most in-demand male model in the world".[14][15] It has even been suggested by some journalists that Fimmel was the inspiration for Sex
          and the City heartthrob 'Jerry' Smith Jerrod.Fimmel appeared on various magazine covers, including France's Numero Homme and America's TV Guide,[17] as well as on top-rating American TV shows in 2003 including Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Sharon
          Osbourne Show, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, MTV's Total Request Live and entertainment TV news program Extra.[12] He also made a cameo appearance in the bar scene of a video clip for Janet Jackson's "Someone to Call My Lover"[18] and
          played a hunk loading hay onto the back of a pick-up truck in Jennifer Lopez's "I'm Real" (original version).</p>

        <p class="p2">Fimmel studied under Hollywood acting coach Ivana Chubbuck, taking two years to pluck up the courage to audition for his first role, saying "half of acting is overcoming your fears [and] letting yourself be vulnerable in front
          of people".[7] He landed the title lead in Warner Bros. 2003 TV series Tarzan, described by CNN as one of the "five hottest things happening in entertainment right now”, in which he did most of his own stunts.[21][22][23] In addition, he
          appeared in the studio's pilot Rocky Point with Lauren Holly in 2005, the Fox film Southern Comfort with Madeleine Stowe in 2006 and The Big Valley with Richard Dreyfuss and Jessica Lange in 2011.n 2020, he appears in HBO Max's science
          fiction drama Raised by Wolves from director Ridley Scott and Scott Free Productions.</p>
